# Commit Standards

## Language Requirements

- Always write commit messages in English
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description

## Examples

- feat: add new feature
- fix: resolve bug
- docs: update documentation
- chore: configure CI/CD pipeline

## Style

- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Capitalize the first letter of the description
